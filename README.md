# captchadetect

The aim of this project was to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) capable of decoding CAPTCHAs (Completely Automated Touring test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart). Many websites use these features to prevent bot raiding, promotion spam, data scraping amongst other methods to abuse websites.

The sets of images that were provided consisted of two major groups:

    * Soft Images

    * Hard Images

The data set is in the .rar file. The project is present at the colab file [CV]Project_2.ipynb and also in html format which allows for fast visualization in a browser.
